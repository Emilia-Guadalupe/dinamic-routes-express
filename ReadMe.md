### New Express project

What's this? This is me trying some dinamic routes with Express. 

For other projects, made with React, I used React Router Dom, but this is my first attempt at doing it manually, with Express. 

I recommend you to install Nodemon in your project if you're going to try this. 

I also used Postman to do all the "Post" routes.
